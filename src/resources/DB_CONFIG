
# The DB_CONFIG configuration file is intended to allow database environment administrators
# to customize environments independent of applications using the environment. For example,
# a database administrator can move the database log and data files to a different location
# without application recompilation. In addition, because the DB_CONFIG file is read when
# the database environment is opened, it can be used to overrule application configuration
# done before that time. For example a database administrator could override the compiled-in
# application cache size to a size more appropriate for a specific machine.

# The DB_CONFIG configuration file has to be copied to the database environment home directory
# which is defined in the 'ddiftp-app.properties' file with the property name 'dbxml.enviroment.home'.
