Bundle.aboutText=\n\
DdiEditor is a DDI-Lifecycle Editing Framework developed by DDA \u2013 Danish Data Archive.\n\
\n\
The DdiEditor is the key tool in a framework of data processing tools and processes composing\n\
data processing of survey datasets. The end product is data documentation in accordance with\n\
international metadata standard of the collection of surveys.\n\
\n\
The DdiEditor produces metadata documentation in DDI-Lifecycle.\n\
\n\
A key objective for development of the DdiEditor is to provide users with a tool which is:\n\
 - configurable\n\
 - extendable\n\
 - customisable\n\
\n\
At the moment the DdiEditor is aimed at data processing for Curation purposes (accommodating\n\
the requirements for a data archive). However, the development project plans to move forward in\n\
the direction of providing functionality for the whole data lifecycle. That is future user groups\n\
will range from researchers carrying out a survey to re-users of data supplying additional meta\n\
data to the original study.\n\
\n\
We encourage interested parties provide feedback on the product as it stands as well as additional\n\
development on the product here:\n\
